# Movie Recommendation System
## Overview
This project builds a Movie Recommendation System using collaborative filtering techniques. It incorporates Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with bias terms to capture user preferences and movie-specific trends, enhancing prediction accuracy.

## Features
Bias-Aware SGD: Adjusts for user and movie biases, improving rating predictions.
Normalization: Explores methods like z-score and mean-centering to enhance data quality and model convergence.
Performance Metrics: Evaluates accuracy using RMSE and MAE.
